              "It's been a while that I don't know what to cook for lunch. I'm always eating the same food over and over again, Noodles! I wish I had
              someone telling me what to cook and eat today."
            </p>
            <p>
              This was what I kept telling myself every single day. Sometimes I went to find exciting recipes on Instagram, but I was looking for a
              more structured and organized plan.

              I had a course in school called XML, which was all about how to trigger APIs and authentications. Students were supposed to work on an
              API project for the final assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time, I was figuring out to decide on the most practical app among tons of API sources. This idea came to my mind to make a
              weekly recipe plan to make my daily routine of cooking and eating much easier.

              I made up my mind to build this application using Node.js as the backend technology. Next, I started to write down the features that
              could possibly be useful, and then I realized that I should add a functional feature to make it even more special.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding a BMI Calculator as an extra step to reach the weekly recipes was a good idea to make it even more personalized.

            A minimal Logo is essential for this app. For the color, I should go with a green tone to bring the feeling of being fresh and healthy.

            Once the data is fetched from the API source, making a BMI calculator function is essential, based on the inputs that users have entered
            through a form on the dashboard.

            The recipes available on the Spoonacular API have a "Search Recipes Complex" endpoint for much more flexibility. I should narrow down the
            results by limiting the number of calories that an individual can take every day.

            Doing some research is required to get the daily calorie intakes based on BMI. The result should be filtered and be inside the range
            defined for males or females.
